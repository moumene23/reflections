When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
#When it's a groupe project work , or when we need some help from some one else.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
# One big difference between Local Git and GitHub,till this lesson, is : there is no staging area in GitHub : just edit and commit...
for the reflection there : if it's a work group and some one add a new commit in GitHub i have to take a look at it before adding it
, just for this reason the pull changes manually is better solution.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
# Branches : different ways in same reposetory. exp : Used whene i have to expeiment some ideas...
# Clones : Same Reposetories in Local and GitHub. exp : Used to share and get some contribution...
# Forks : Same Reposetories in GitHub. exp : Used whene i don't have access to modify 
          the repository of some one else so i fork it and modify it in my own github or local.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
# avoiding severall conflicts and allowing fast merging process
